# 🎨 KeyDoodles

Type. Draw. Doodle. Experiment.

KeyDoodles is an interactive web-based generative art playground where typing and freehand sketching directly shape what appears on the canvas.

There is no goal.
There is no “right way.”
Just input → motion → art.

# 🖥️ What is this?

KeyDoodles runs entirely in the browser.
Your keystrokes and mouse movements create live visuals using a fullscreen canvas.

You can:

Type to generate motion and shapes

Draw freely with your mouse

Switch shapes and themes on the fly

Watch stats react to how you type

It’s part typing tool, part art toy, part experiment.

# ✨ What You Can Do
⌨️ Type to Create

Every keystroke affects motion, curves, and physics

🌐 How It Runs

No servers

No frameworks

No setup

Just open the page and start interacting.

The entire experience is powered by:

HTML Canvas

Vanilla JavaScript

CSS

# 🧪 Experimental by Nature

KeyDoodles is intentionally:

Minimal

Weird

Non-traditional

Some things are chaotic on purpose.
The canvas is meant to feel alive, not controlled.

🚀 Running It

You can open it in any modern browser:

Open index.html

Or deploy it on any static hosting platform (GitHub Pages, Netlify, etc.)

🧠 Why It Exists

KeyDoodles is an exploration of:

Input as art

Typing beyond productivity

Canvas-based interaction

Creative coding without rules

🔮 Future Ideas

Save & share artwork

Audio-reactive typing

Hidden keyboard combos

More sketch tools

Controlled chaos modes
